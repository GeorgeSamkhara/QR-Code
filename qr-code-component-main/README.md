This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

It was challenging, because I just started to learn front-end(CSS/HTMl for now, but going to learn Js too), I spent 1 week figuring out this design's text & Image styles, it was painful not gonna lie lol, but thing is, to Never Give Up. Thank you Frontend Mentor for this challenge.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### Continued development

I think, after this challange I'm going to focus on CSS Text costumization*
